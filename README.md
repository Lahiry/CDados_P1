Twitter product/brand classifier.

This is a coursework about sentiment classification.
First I'll choose a product or brand, for instance "Apple".
Then I'll download a reasonable amount of tweets using the API Key and the
Tweepy Python API.
After those tweets are downloaded, I'll need to classify them by hand into
categories, for instance "Happy with Apple" and "Unhappy with Apple"
Using the tweets I classified, I'll be able to then classify new tweets ins
tantly given the conditional probabilities of the words they contain based
on the two categories I described above
