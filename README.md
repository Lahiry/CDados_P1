Twitter product/brand classifier.

This is a coursework about sentiment classification.
First we chose the brand PlayStation.
Then we downloaded a reasonable amount of tweets using the API Key and the
Tweepy Python API.
After those tweets were downloaded, we classified them by hand into
five categories: very irrelevant, irrelevant, neutral, relevant and very relevant.
Using the tweets we classified, we then were able to classify new tweets ins
tantly given the conditional probabilities of the words they contain based
on the five categories I described above

Critérios de classificação:
0 - Muito irrelevante
1 - Irrelevante
2 - Neutro
3 - Relevante
4 - Muito rrelevante
